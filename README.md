# Problem Explanation 🔄🔡🔠

This program takes a string from the user and **inverts the case of every letter** in the string:

- If a letter is uppercase (capital), it becomes lowercase (small).
- If a letter is lowercase, it becomes uppercase.
- All other characters (like spaces or symbols) stay the same.
- The program then prints the new string after inverting the case of all letters.

**Example:**  
If the user enters:  
`Hello World!`  
The output will be:  
```
hELLO wORLD!
```

This is useful if you want to quickly swap the case for all letters in a sentence or a word. ✨📝
